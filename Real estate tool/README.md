# üèôÔ∏è **Om Thaware's RealEstate Research Tool**

We are going to build a user-friendly news research tool designed for effortless information retrieval. Users can input article URLs and ask questions to receive relevant insights from the real-estate domain. (But its features can be extended to any domain.)

### Features

  - Load URLs to fetch article content.
  - Process article content using **LangChain's UnstructuredURL Loader**.
  - Construct an embedding vector with **HuggingFace embeddings** and use **ChromaDB** as the vector store for quick and effective information retrieval.
  - Interact with a local LLM (**Llama 3 via Ollama**) to get answers and source URLs from the articles by inputting queries.

### **Set-up**

1.  **Install dependencies:** Run the following command to install all necessary packages.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Download Ollama and a model:** Install Ollama and then pull a model like Llama 3 from your terminal. For example:

    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3
    ```

3.  **Run the Streamlit app:** Start the application by running this command.

    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

### **Usage/Examples**

The web app will open in your browser after the setup is complete.

  - Enter URLs directly into the sidebar.
  - Click **"Process URLs"** to start loading and processing the data.
  - The system will perform text splitting and generate embedding vectors using **HuggingFace's Embedding Model**.
  - These embeddings will be stored in **ChromaDB**.
  - You can now ask questions to get answers based on the provided news articles.
  - The tutorial uses the following news articles as examples:
      - `https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/21/how-the-federal-reserves-rate-policy-affects-mortgages.html`
      - `https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/why-mortgage-rates-jumped-despite-fed-interest-rate-cut.html`
      - `https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/17/wall-street-sees-upside-in-2025-for-these-dividend-paying-real-estate-stocks.html`
